## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

- **Monorepo Setup**: Managed using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) workspace for managing dependencies across multiple apps.

## Getting Started

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (>=7.x) for managing dependencies

### Installation



1. If you don't have pnpm installed:
   
   Install `pnpm` globally using `npm`:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ``` 
   
   To confirm itâ€™s installed, check the version:
   
   ```bash
   pnpm -v
   ```
   
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
